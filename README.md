# Partner Guide for OpenShift and Container Certification

This document will  guide you through the process of obtaining a “Red Hat Certified” designation for an application that targets Red Hat OpenShift as a deployment platform. It also covers the certification of containers that use Red Hat technology.

The process involves preparing your application so that it meets the certification  criteria, submitting it to Red Hat for review and approval, and publishing it so that it is is available for consumption.

It should be noted that the certification is not a one-time action, but assumes a commitment to maintaining it across its life cycle, i.e., updating it as needed for security or other reasons.
