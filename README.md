# Introduction

Welcome to Red Hat Connect for Technology Partners. This guide provides instructions on how to register for the Red Hat Connect for Technology Partner program. This document will also guide you through the process of obtaining a “Red Hat Certified” designation for an application that you have made available via a Linux container using Red Hat technology.

The process involves preparing your containerized application so that it meets certain criteria as specified in the Red Hat Certification Policy Guide, submitting it to Red Hat for review and certification, and publishing it so that the containerized application is available for consumption.

It should be noted that the ability to maintain the certification requires a commitment to maintaining the trustworthiness of the container, i.e., updating it as needed for security or other reasons.

If you are interested in certifying your application and an operator for that application please note there are two distinct workflows you must complete. The certified application image workflow AND the certified operator image workflow.
