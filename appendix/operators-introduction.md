# Introduction to Operators

An Operator is a method of packaging, deploying and managing a Kubernetes application. A Kubernetes application is an application that is both deployed on Kubernetes and managed using the Kubernetes APIs and kubectl/oc tooling. You can think of Operators as the runtime that manages this type of application on Kubernetes.

## Distributing Operators

As a partner, there are three places where you can contribute an operator, each with a different publishing endpoint:
