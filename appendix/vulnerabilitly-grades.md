# Container Image Vulnerability Grades

As software package vulnerabilities are discovered it is important to rebuild container images to keep them up-to-date. Without automation this process quickly becomes onerous and reflects poorly on the catalog listing. Organizations frequently run vulnerable software but few want to download vulnerable software. It is a requirement of Red Hat Connect Partner Program that the partner maintain the image certification. Red Hat publishes a [Container Health Index](https://access.redhat.com/articles/2803031) as described below to inform users about those situations where an image might need to be updated.
