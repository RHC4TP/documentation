# Building an Operator - In Depth

## Certified Operator Build Guide

Please refer to the [Certified Operator Build Guide](https://redhat-connect.gitbook.io/certified-operator-guide/) for an in depth tutorial that covers the more technical aspects of building an operator. It mostly covers Helm and Ansible workflows, and only touches on Golang.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Please be aware that there are circumstances where customers require that an Operator work in an airgap or disconnected environment. If this requirement is applicable to your operator, please follow the instructions here: [Offline-Enabled Operators](https://redhat-connect.gitbook.io/certified-operator-guide/appendix/offline-enabled-operators)
