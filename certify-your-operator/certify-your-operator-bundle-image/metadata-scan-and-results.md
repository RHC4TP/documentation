# Bundle Image Scan & Results

The Scan takes about 1-2 hours. You can see the update of the Scan in the Certification Test column. Once the scan has completed you will see a Passed or Failed Status in the Certification Test column. Example of a Passed Image:

If the checklist is completed and your Bundle Image has Passed Results, you can Publish your Image. To Publish your Image, you can click the dropdown arrow next to the image and select Publish.
