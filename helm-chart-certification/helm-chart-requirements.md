| **Chart must set the kubeVersion field to indicate the minimum Kubernetes version supported**                                     | To ensure that the chart is supported on the target version of OpenShift                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Chart must include one or more** [**tests**](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/chart\_tests/)**, located in the templates directory** | To verify successful chart installation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
