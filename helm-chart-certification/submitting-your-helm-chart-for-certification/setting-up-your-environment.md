# Setting up your environment

You will use the [git](https://git-scm.com/) command, available on all major platforms. For detailed information on this command, consult its [documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc) or the [GitHub cheat sheet](https://training.github.com/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet/). Make sure you have _git_ on the system you'll use to submit your chart.

Run the following command to create a copy of the GitHub repository in your local environment:

`git clone https://github.com/openshift-helm-charts/charts/`

Then go to your chart's directory under charts/partners/&lt;company&gt;/ to add the material you will submit for certification review.
