# Setting up your environment

In order to certify your Helm Chart, you will need to use Git/GitHub to share your test results and your chart for our certification process.

To set up your GitHub account and repository, please refer to this [documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc) or the [GitHub cheat sheet](https://training.github.com/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet/). Make sure you have _git_ on the system you'll use to submit your chart.

To submit a pull request, you need to **fork** the Git repository and **clone** it to your local system.&#x20;

`git clone https://github.com/openshift-helm-charts/charts/`

``

If you had followed the previous steps, you should see an **OWNERS** file under your chart directory within your organization directory.

> `/`charts/partners/\<company-name>/\<project-name>/OWNERS

Then go to your chart's directory under `charts/partners/<company>/<project-name>/` to add the material you will submit for certification review.
