# Verifying your Helm chart

Certification for Helm charts relies on the [`chart-verifier`](https://github.com/redhat-certification/chart-verifier) tool. This is an open source tool used to verify a Helm chart against Red Hat certification requirements and Red Hat recommendations.

The tool can run in your own environment without the need to submit results to Red Hat, so it can be used as needed during the chart development cycle.
