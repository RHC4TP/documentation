# Certification Workflow

This guide will go through the Certification Process for the Red Hat OpenShift and Containers in Red Hat Connect. There are 3 options for certification on Red Hat OpenShift:&#x20;

1. Standalone containerized application
2. Application deployed with a Helm chart
3. Application deployed with an Operator&#x20;

In the case of Helm chart or operator certification, you must first complete the container certification for all the components or operands your application utilizes.&#x20;
