# Certification Workflow

This guide will go through the Certification Process for the Red Hat OpenShift and Container Zone in Red Hat Connect. There are 2 types of Certifications: 

1. Container Application 
2. Operator 

In order to have a Certified Operator, you must first complete the Container Application Certification for all the applications you will be deploying with your operator.
