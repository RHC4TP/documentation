# Certification Workflow

This guide will go through the Certification Process for the Red Hat OpenShift and Container Zone in Red Hat Connect. There are 2 options for certification on Red Hat OpenShift: 

1. Application deployed with a Helm chart
2. Application deployed with an Operator 

In either case, you must first complete the container certification for all the components you will be deploying with your Helm chart or Operator.

Some IBM Partners program can be pursued after the Red Hat OpenShift  certification workflow has been completed. More information can be found here: [IBM Partner Programs](https://redhat-connect.gitbook.io/partner-guide-for-red-hat-openshift-and-container/program-on-boarding/ibm-partner-programs).
