# Certification Workflow

This guide will go through the Certification Process for the Red Hat OpenShift and Containers in Red Hat Connect. There are 2 options for certification on Red Hat OpenShift:&#x20;

1. Application deployed with a Helm chart
2. Application deployed with an Operator&#x20;

In either case, you must first complete the container certification for all the components you will be deploying with your Helm chart or Operator.&#x20;

Some IBM Partner programs can be pursued after the Red Hat OpenShift certification workflow has been completed. More information can be found here: [IBM Partner Programs](ibm-partner-programs.md).&#x20;
