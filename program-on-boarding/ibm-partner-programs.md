# IBM Partner Programs

Apart from the Partner Connect Program, if you are certifying a Kubernetes Operator there are other programs you can pursue in parallel to your Red Hat certification.&#x20;

### Red Hat Marketplace operated by IBM

Red Hat® Marketplace is an open cloud marketplace that makes it easier to discover and access certified software for container-based environments in public clouds and on-prem. With automated deployment, software is immediately available to deploy on any Red Hat® OpenShift® cluster, providing a fast, integrated experience.&#x20;

There are some additional technical requirements needed to be implemented for your Operator to qualify for the Red Hat Marketplace. Read the [documentation](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red\_hat\_openshift\_certification/4.9/html/red\_hat\_openshift\_software\_certification\_workflow\_guide/con\_operator-certification\_openshift-sw-cert-workflow-complete-pre-certification-checklist-for-containers) carefully.

### IBM Cloud Paks

With Red Hat OpenShift at the core, IBM Cloud Paks accelerates new and existing clients' journeys to the cloud, while delivering business value. IBM is a thought leader in application and integration modernization, with a worldwide presence that includes a global sales force with enterprise customer relationships in every country and local technical skills.&#x20;

Once your software is certified, you can promote your offering on the IBM Marketplace — with more than 37M visits each month -- and leverage IBM sellers, Business Partners, client centers, Garages, and technical expertise worldwide.

Red Hat Operator certification is a prerequisite for becoming Certified for IBM Cloud Paks. The subsequent steps are:

* Identify the IBM Cloud Pak with which your software has the most affinity
* Decide to partner
* Meet the technical certification criteria
* Demonstrate the value of your software running with the Cloud Pak
* Create sales enablement collateral and go to market
