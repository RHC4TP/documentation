# Program Prerequisites

### Before you begin

Before you begin OpenShift Container or Operator certification, a few prerequisites must be met:

1. You must be a Red Hat partner in good standing. If you are not already a Red Hat technology partner, [follow these instructions](https://redhat-connect.gitbook.io/red-hat-partner-connect-general-guide/initial-onboarding/register) to begin.
2. You must be a [TSANet](https://tsanet.org/) member or a member through Red Hat's limited membership program. If you are not yet a TSANet member, Red Hat will sponsor a 1:1 limited membership. [Read more about TSANet membership through Red Hat](https://redhat-connect.gitbook.io/red-hat-partner-connect-general-guide/general/tsanet).
3. You must request and be approved for the Red Hat Partner Connect Operator & Container Zone.

Additionally, due to the nature of containerized software using Red Hat base images, you may be required to adhere to our [export compliance guidelines for partners](https://redhat-connect.gitbook.io/red-hat-partner-connect-general-guide/general/export-compliance).

### Getting Red Hat software

Once you complete the prerequisites, you may need download Not-for-resale \(NFR\) access to Red Hat software such as Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. To request software access as a partner, [follow these instructions](https://redhat-connect.gitbook.io/red-hat-partner-connect-general-guide/software-access/requesting-software). Once your access has been approved, you may [download software from the Customer Portal](https://access.redhat.com/downloads/).
